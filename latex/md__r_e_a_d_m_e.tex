This project contains code written for a project in the class CS201 Data Structures \& Algorithms at the University of Alabama. This code is provided online to showcase \& store my work, and hopefully provide a reference to others in the future. However, copying this code verbatim or copying large portions of it for other classes will likely be academic misconduct.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{CS201 Phase 2 Project\+:}{CS201 Phase 2 Project\+:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
The objective of this project is to create a class for a 2-\/3-\/4 Tree in C++. It makes use of my previous proejct in this class to make a Circular Dynamic Array, reusing its code for storing information in the nodes of the tree.
