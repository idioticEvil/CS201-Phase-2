# NOTE: 
This project contains code written for a project in the class CS201 Data Structures & Algorithms at the University of Alabama. This code is provided online to showcase & store my work, and hopefully provide a reference to others in the future. However, copying this code verbatim or copying large portions of it for other classes will likely be academic misconduct.

# CS201 Phase 2 Project:
The objective of this project is to create a class for a 2-3-4 Tree in C++. It makes use of my previous proejct in this class to make a Circular Dynamic Array, reusing its code for storing information in the nodes of the tree.
